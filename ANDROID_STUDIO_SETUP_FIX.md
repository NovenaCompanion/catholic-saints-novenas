# Android Studio Setup Fix - Catholic Saints & Novenas

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
Android Studio is reading both iOS and Android components because you opened the **entire project folder** instead of just the Android directory.

## ✅ **Solution: Open ONLY the Android Folder**

### Step 1: Close Current Project
1. Close Android Studio completely
2. Clear any cached project data

### Step 2: Open Correct Directory
**❌ DON'T open:** `C:\Users\Raymond\Desktop\MY NOVENA COMPANION`
**✅ DO open:** `C:\Users\Raymond\Desktop\MY NOVENA COMPANION\android`

### Step 3: Android Studio Import Process
1. Open Android Studio
2. Click "Open an Existing Project"
3. Navigate to: `C:\Users\Raymond\Desktop\MY NOVENA COMPANION\android`
4. Select the **android** folder (not the parent folder)
5. Click "OK"

### Step 4: Verify Correct Project Structure
You should see in Android Studio:
```
android/
├── app/
├── build.gradle (file, not folder)
├── gradle/
├── gradlew
└── settings.gradle
```

**NOT:**
```
MY NOVENA COMPANION/
├── android/
├── ios/          ← This causes the conflict
├── client/
└── server/
```

## 🔨 **Build APK After Correct Setup**
1. Build → Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) → Build APK(s)
2. Wait 10-15 minutes for first build
3. Find APK at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## 🎯 **Key Point**
Always open **ONLY** the `android` folder in Android Studio, never the parent project folder that contains both iOS and Android platforms.

## 🚀 **Expected Result**
- Clean Android-only build environment
- No iOS interference
- Successful APK compilation
- Ready for Google Play Store submission
