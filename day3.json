{"id":66,"saintId":10,"day":3,"title":"Day 3: Valuing What is Eternal","content":"PRAYER: Come, O Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful, and kindle in them the fire of Your Divine Love. Send forth Your Spirit, and they shall be created, and You shall renew the face of the earth.\n\nREADING: \"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\" (Matthew 6:19-21)\n\nREFLECTION: Today we focus on shifting our perspective from temporal to eternal values. The world offers many \"treasures\" that fade, break, or disappoint. Through our consecration to Mary, we learn to value what lasts forever â€“ faith, hope, love, and union with God. Mary always points us toward these eternal treasures.\n\nDAILY PRACTICE: Choose one \"treasure\" you typically pursue (comfort, acclaim, possessions, etc.) and intentionally set it aside today. Instead, practice one spiritual work of mercy that builds up heavenly treasure.\n\nCONSECRATION PRAYER: O Mary, Virgin most powerful and Mother of Mercy, Queen of Heaven and Refuge of Sinners, I consecrate myself to your Immaculate Heart. I consecrate to you my body and soul, my goods, both interior and exterior, and even the value of all my good actions, past, present and future, leaving to you the entire and full right of disposing of me and all that belongs to me, without exception, according to your good pleasure, for the greater glory of God, in time and in eternity. Amen.","createdAt":"2025-05-11T12:24:00.183Z"}
