{"id":9,"name":"54 Day Rosary Novena To The Blessed Virgin Mary","title":" 'Whoever desires to obtain favors from me should make three novenas of the prayers of the Rosary, and three novenas in thanksgiving.'","description":"About the Novena\n\nIn an apparition of Our Lady of Pompeii, which\n occurred in 1884 at Naples, in the house of Commander Agrelli, the heavenly Mother deigned to make known the manner in which she desires to be invoked.\n For thirteen months Fortuna Agrelli, the daughter of the Commander, had endured dreadful sufferings and torturous cramps; she had been given up by the most celebrated physicians. On February 16, 1884, the afflicted\n girl and her relatives commenced a novena of Rosaries. \n\nThe  Queen of the Holy Rosary favored her with an apparition on March 3rd. Mary, sitting upon a high throne, surrounded by luminous figures, held the divine Child on her lap, and in her hand a Rosary. The Virgin Mother and the holy Infant were clad in gold embroidered garments.\n\n They were accompanied by St. Dominic and St. Catherine of Siena.\n The throne was profusely decorated with flowers; the  beauty of Our Lady was marvelous.\n \nMary looked upon the sufferer with maternal\n tenderness, and the patient saluted her with the words:\n 'Queen of the Holy Rosary, be gracious to me; restore me to health! I have already prayed to thee in a novena, O Mary, but have not yet experienced thy aid. I am so anxious to be cured!'\n 'Child,' responded the Blessed Virgin, thou hast\n invoked me by various titles and has always obtained favors from me. Now, since thou hast\n called me by that title so pleasing to me, 'Queen of the Holy Rosary,' I can no longer refuse the favor thou dost petition; for this name is most precious and dear to me. Make three\n novenas, and thou shalt obtain all.'\n Once more the Queen of the Holy Rosary appeared to her and said, 'Whoever desires to obtain favors from me should make three novenas of the prayers of the Rosary, and three novenas in thanksgiving.'\n “This miracle of the Rosary made a very deep\n impression on Pope Leo XIII, and greatly contributed to the fact that in so many circular letters he urged all Christians to love the Rosary and say it fervently.”1 The Novena consists of five decades of the Rosary  each day for twenty seven days in petition; then immediately five decades each day for twenty seven days in thanksgiving. whether or not the request has been granted.\n\n The meditations vary from day to day. On the first\n day meditate on the Joyful Mysteries;\n\nOn the second day the Sorrowful Mysteries;\n And on the third day the Glorious\n Mysteries: on the fourth day meditate again on the Joyful  Mysteries; and so on throughout the fifty four days.\n \n\n\n","imageUrl":null,"feastDay":null,"patronOf":null,"born":null,"died":null,"prayer":"Joyful Mysteries\nOpening prayer\nThe first 27 days are in petition:\n\nHail, Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, my Mother Mary, hail!
