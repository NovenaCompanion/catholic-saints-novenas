  "content": "Holy Gospel of St. Matthew, 7,1-14\nJudge not, that you may not be judged. For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it small be measured to you again.\n\nAnd why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye; and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye? Or how sayest thou to thy brother: let me cast the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam is in thy own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam of thy own eye and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. \n\nGive not that which is holy to dogs. Neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet: and turning upon you, they tear you. Ask, and it shall be given you: seek and you shall find: Knock and it shall be opened to you. For everyone that asketh, receiveth: and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be Opened.\n\nOr what man of whom if his son shall ask bread will he reach him a stone? Or, if he shall ask him a fish: will he reach him a serpent? If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?\n\nAll things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do also to them. For this is the law and the prophets. Enter ye into the narrow gate: for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there are who go in therat. How narrow is the gate and straight is the way that leadeth to life, and few are there that find it!"
