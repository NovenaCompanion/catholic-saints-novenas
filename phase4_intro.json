What is to be studied in Jesus Christ?\n\nFirst: The Man-God, His grace and glory; then His rights to sovereign dominion over us; since, having renounced satan and the world, we have taken Jesus Christ as our Lord.\n\nSecond: His interior life; namely, the virtues and the acts of His Sacred Heart; His association with Mary in the mysteries of the Annunciation and Incarnation. During His infancy and hidden life at the feast of Cana and on Calvary. . ."
