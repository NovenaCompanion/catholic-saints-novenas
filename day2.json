{"id":65,"saintId":10,"day":2,"title":"Day 2: Recognizing What Separates Us from God","content":"PRAYER: Come, O Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful, and kindle in them the fire of Your Divine Love. Send forth Your Spirit, and they shall be created, and You shall renew the face of the earth.\n\nREADING: \"What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you? You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God.\" (James 4:1-2)\n\nREFLECTION: Today we consider the root causes of our separation from God. Worldly attachments, selfish desires, and material concerns often distract us from what truly matters. In our quest for Marian consecration, we must honestly examine these attachments and begin the process of letting them go.\n\nDAILY PRACTICE: Spend time in silent examination of conscience. What worldly attachments or disordered desires are holding you back from complete surrender to Jesus through Mary? Write these down and offer them in prayer.\n\nCONSECRATION PRAYER: O Mary, Virgin most powerful and Mother of Mercy, Queen of Heaven and Refuge of Sinners, I consecrate myself to your Immaculate Heart. I consecrate to you my body and soul, my goods, both interior and exterior, and even the value of all my good actions, past, present and future, leaving to you the entire and full right of disposing of me and all that belongs to me, without exception, according to your good pleasure, for the greater glory of God, in time and in eternity. Amen.","createdAt":"2025-05-11T12:23:44.436Z"}
