  "content": "Holy Gospel of St. Matthew, 5,48; 6,1-15\nBe ye therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect. Take head that you do not your justice before men, to be seen by them: otherwise you shall not have the reward of your Father who is in heaven.\n\nTherefore when thou dost an almsdeed sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honoured by men. Amen, I say to you, they have received their reward. and when thou dost alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.\n\nThat thy alms may be in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will repay thee. And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites that love to stand and pray in the synagogues and corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men; Amen, I say to you, they have received their reward. \n\nBut thou, when thou have received their reward. But thou, when thou shalt pray, enter into thy chamber, and having shut the door, pray to the Father in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee. And when you are praying, speak not much, as the heathens. \n\nFor they think that in their much speaking they may be heard. Be not you therefore like to them; for your Father knoweth what is needful for you, before you ask him. Thus therefore shall you pray: Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our supersubstantial bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation.\n\nBut deliver us from evil. Amen. for if you will forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will forgive you also your offences. But if you will not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive you your offences.\nNow turn to page 8 for Prayers."
